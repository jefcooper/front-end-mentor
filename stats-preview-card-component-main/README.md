### What I learned

From actually doing the challenge, I learned that I didn't fully understand how the colorization effect used by the designer was done.  I thought I had it in a codepen, but when I tried it out here, it was too dark.  Turns out the image has 70% opacity and the color background is 100% opaque.  In the end I got the color match exact.
