## My process

### Built with

This is a minimal toolset build.  A very small amount of javascript is used to prevent scrolling when the mobile menu is opened.  The mobile dropdown is performed using the checkbox hack using css.

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a larger project that required pulling together skills from multiple other challenges including:

- positioning and layering backgrounds,
- mobile menu
- responsive design
