## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- used a CSS variable for the card background color to enable setting the button text to background easily.
- struggled with trying to use flex-wrap until I realized that the rounded corners are impossible with dynamic wrapping.
- ultimately settled on switching flex-direction from column to row at an appropriate breakpoint.
